The worm tunnels perpendicular to the pages, i.e., horizontally through the thicknesses along the line from the first page of V1 to the last page of V2.\n",

Careful: “first page” means the very first page inside Volume 1, adjacent to the front cover. From that page to the outside of the volume, the worm would go through that page toward the outer front cover? The worm’s start is at the first page, so immediately it would have to go through that first page? However the problem typically intends the worm starts at the first page of the first volume and gnaws to the last page of the second volume, moving through material between them including covers and gaps between volumes.)\n",

       "- the entire thickness of Volume 2 up to its last page: includes all of Volume 2’s pages up to the last page, but not the back cover if ending at the last page.\n",
       "\n",
       "A neat trick: measure distance along the line from the very first page of V1 to the very last page of V2 by subtracting the thicknesses of the insignificant outer bits that the worm does not traverse. The worm starts at the first page of V1 and ends at the last page of V2, so it does not gnaw through the front cover of V1 (since that starts beyond the first page) nor through the back cover of V2 (since that is beyond the last page) and it does not gnaw through the interiors of the two front/back pages beyond those endpoints.\n",
